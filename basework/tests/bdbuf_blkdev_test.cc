    " The Block Device Buffer Management implements a cache between the disk\n"
    " devices and file systems.  The code provides read-ahead and write queuing to\n"
    " the drivers and fast cache look-up using an AVL tree.\n"
    "\n"
    " The block size used by a file system can be set at runtime and must be a\n"
    " multiple of the disk device block size.  The disk device's physical block\n"
    " size is called the media block size.  The file system can set the block size\n"
    " it uses to a larger multiple of the media block size.  The driver must be\n"
    " able to handle buffers sizes larger than one media block.\n"
    "\n"
    " The user configures the amount of memory to be used as buffers in the cache,\n"
    " and the minimum and maximum buffer size.  The cache will allocate additional\n"
    " memory for the buffer descriptors and groups.  There are enough buffer\n"
    " descriptors allocated so all the buffer memory can be used as minimum sized\n"
    " buffers.\n"
    "\n"
    " The cache is a single pool of buffers.  The buffer memory is divided into\n"
    " groups where the size of buffer memory allocated to a group is the maximum\n"
    " buffer size.  A group's memory can be divided down into small buffer sizes\n"
    " that are a multiple of 2 of the minimum buffer size.  A group is the minimum\n"
    " allocation unit for buffers of a specific size.  If a buffer of maximum size\n"
    " is request the group will have a single buffer.  If a buffer of minimum size\n"
    " is requested the group is divided into minimum sized buffers and the\n"
    " remaining buffers are held ready for use.  A group keeps track of which\n"
    " buffers are with a file system or driver and groups who have buffer in use\n"
    " cannot be realloced.  Groups with no buffers in use can be taken and\n"
    " realloced to a new size.  This is how buffers of different sizes move around\n"
    " the cache.\n"
    " The buffers are held in various lists in the cache.  All buffers follow this\n"
    " state machine:\n"
    "\n"
    " @dot\n"
    " digraph state {\n"
    " }\n"
    " @enddot\n"
    "\n"
    " Empty or cached buffers are added to the LRU list and removed from this\n"
    " queue when a caller requests a buffer.  This is referred to as getting a\n"
    " buffer in the code and the event get in the state diagram.  The buffer is\n"
    " assigned to a block and inserted to the AVL based on the block/device key.\n"
    " If the block is to be read by the user and not in the cache it is transfered\n"
    " from the disk into memory.  If no buffers are on the LRU list the modified\n"
    " list is checked.  If buffers are on the modified the swap out task will be\n"
    " woken.  The request blocks until a buffer is available for recycle.\n"
    "\n"
    " A block being accessed is given to the file system layer and not accessible\n"
    " to another requester until released back to the cache.  The same goes to a\n"
    " buffer in the transfer state.  The transfer state means being read or\n"
    " written.  If the file system has modified the block and releases it as\n"
    " modified it placed on the cache's modified list and a hold timer\n"
    " initialised.  The buffer is held for the hold time before being written to\n"
    " disk.  Buffers are held for a configurable period of time on the modified\n"
    " list as a write sets the state to transfer and this locks the buffer out\n"
    " from the file system until the write completes.  Buffers are often accessed\n"
    " and modified in a series of small updates so if sent to the disk when\n"
    " released as modified the user would have to block waiting until it had been\n"
    " written.  This would be a performance problem.\n"
    "\n"
    " The code performs multiple block reads and writes.  Multiple block reads or\n"
    " read-ahead increases performance with hardware that supports it.  It also\n"
    " helps with a large cache as the disk head movement is reduced.  It however\n"
    " is a speculative operation so excessive use can remove valuable and needed\n"
    " blocks from the cache.  The read-ahead is triggered after two misses of\n"
    " ascending consecutive blocks or a read hit of a block read by the\n"
    " most-resent read-ahead transfer.  The read-ahead works per disk, but all\n"
    " transfers are issued by the read-ahead task.\n"
    "\n"
    " The cache has the following lists of buffers:\n"
    "  - LRU: Accessed or transfered buffers released in least recently used\n"
    "  order.  Empty buffers will be placed to the front.\n"
    "  - Modified: Buffers waiting to be written to disk.\n"
    "  - Sync: Buffers to be synchronized with the disk.\n"
    "\n"
    " A cache look-up will be performed to find a suitable buffer.  A suitable\n"
    " buffer is one that matches the same allocation size as the device the buffer\n"
    " is for.  The a buffer's group has no buffers in use with the file system or\n"
    " driver the group is reallocated.  This means the buffers in the group are\n"
    " invalidated, resized and placed on the LRU queue.  There is a performance\n"
    " issue with this design.  The reallocation of a group may forced recently\n"
    " accessed buffers out of the cache when they should not.  The design should be\n"
    " change to have groups on a LRU list if they have no buffers in use.\n"
